The Arizona Highway Patrol stumbled across a blackened crater in the side of a mountain at the end of a long stretch of desert road. After an investigation, they learned that an Air Force sergeant from a nearby military base had attached a rocket-assisted takeoff unit to the roof of a 1967 Chevy Impala. He got up to about 80 mph, and then fired the things off. Within seconds the car was traveling at 350 mph. The crater was found in the mountainside 100 feet off the ground. Who do you think will be the \"dummy\" to test this myth? The Pop Rocks and soda legend concerns a boy known as little Mikey, who was featured in commercials for Life cereal. Some years later, Mikey was challenged by his friends to eat six packs of Pop Rocks candy with six cans of soda. According to the myth, the carbon dioxide in the candy combined with the carbon dioxide in the soda to create so much pressure that Mikey's stomach exploded and he died. Our MythBusters risk their lives for you, the viewer, in these two death-defying experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E",

First, they contemplate the one about an obese woman on a trans-Atlantic flight whose derriere is suctioned into the plane's toilet after flushing, forcing the plane to land before she can be removed. Will the bottom fall out of this myth? How about the one involving a friend of a friend who thought she was shot while sitting in her car in a supermarket parking lot on a very hot day? The story goes that when the paramedics arrived, they found her head splattered with a mass of raw biscuit dough. And then there's the leaping lawyer. Some guy (apparently a lawyer), kept bouncing off a plate-glass window on the 24th floor of a high-rise building. After one too many impacts, the window shattered and the guy fell 24 floors to the ground, where he promptly died. Another day, another deadly myth.\u003C/p\u003E",
